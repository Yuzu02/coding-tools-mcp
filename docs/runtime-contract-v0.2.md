# Coding Tools MCP Runtime Contract v0.2

Status: implemented contract for `coding-tools-mcp` 0.2.x.

Protocol target: MCP `2025-11-25`, with explicit compatibility for `2025-06-18`.

This contract describes one stable, model-neutral coding tool set. There are no
tool profiles and the server does not add or remove process tools dynamically.
`apply_patch` is the only direct file-mutation primitive; `edit_file` is not
provided. Permission modes alter command policy, not the advertised catalog.

One switch, `--dangerously-fake-readonly-annotations`, rewrites the exposure hints
in `tools/list` for clients that refuse mutating tools by annotation. It is not a
tool profile: the catalog, the schemas, and what every tool actually does are all
unchanged, and no tool is hidden. It requires `dangerous` permission mode, requires
authentication over HTTP, and is reported by `server_info.annotation_override` and
the server card, both of which continue to publish the real annotations recorded
below. Unless that switch is set, the annotations in this document are what
`tools/list` returns.

## Protocol and transports

- Streamable HTTP uses `POST /mcp`. `DELETE /mcp` terminates the selected
  `Mcp-Session-Id`. Because this server does not provide an SSE stream,
  `GET /mcp` and `HEAD /mcp` return `405`.
- Each successful HTTP `initialize` creates an independent transport runtime.
  Its default cwd and request context are not shared with other MCP sessions.
  Commands and retained output are workspace resources, so another
  authenticated client for the same workspace can continue a command using
  the `command_id` returned by `exec_command`.
- Subsequent HTTP messages must include the returned `Mcp-Session-Id` and the
  negotiated `MCP-Protocol-Version`. Unknown or expired sessions return `404`.
- JSON-RPC batches are rejected. Cancellation uses
  `notifications/cancelled.params.requestId`.
- stdio is newline-delimited JSON-RPC. stdout contains protocol messages only;
  diagnostics and logs go to stderr.
- The only advertised server capability is stable tools with
  `listChanged: false`. Logging, resources, prompts, sampling, and elicitation
  are not advertised.

The server accepts only the protocol versions listed above. A supported version
is echoed in `initialize`; arbitrary older dates and unknown future dates are
rejected rather than compared lexicographically.

## Automatic project context

Initialization automatically loads bounded root project instructions from
`AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.MD`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `CLAUDE.MD` when present. The content
is included in the MCP `instructions` field, so an agent does not need an
`open_workspace` call. Nested instruction files are indexed by path but are not
eagerly injected. Loading is UTF-8 safe and bounded by file-count, scan-count,
depth, per-file, and total-byte limits.

## Workspace and patch guarantees

- One server runtime owns one canonical workspace root.
- Direct path inputs are workspace-relative. Absolute paths, `..` traversal,
  NUL bytes, and symlink escapes are rejected.
- `apply_patch` parses and validates every operation before committing.
- Every replacement is prepared and fsynced in the target directory, then
  installed with `os.replace`.
- Existing mode bits, UTF-8 BOMs, and CRLF/LF style are preserved. Moves inherit
  the source mode.
- Baseline hashes and modes are checked before commit and again immediately
  before replacement. Conflicts are retryable and never silently overwrite a
  newly-created target.
- A failed multi-file commit restores all backups. Portable filesystems do not
  offer a true transaction across directories, so a rollback failure is
  reported explicitly as `PATCH_ROLLBACK_FAILED` with recovery details.

## Result contract

Every valid `tools/call` response contains:

```json
{
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Short agent-readable result"}],
  "structuredContent": {"ok": true},
  "isError": false
}
```

`content` is concise model-facing text and is never a JSON serialization of the
whole payload. Its normal size is governed by each tool's own per-call limits
(`max_bytes`, `max_output_bytes`, `max_results`, ...), without the former
16 KiB renderer preview cap. A 2,162,688-byte emergency safety ceiling protects
clients from pathological individual entries that count-based limits cannot
bound. Command results always begin with a status line (status, exit code,
signal, timeout). Stable pageable truncation names an executable continuation
call (`read_output(output_ref=..., offset=...)`,
`read_file(path=..., start_line=...)`, ...); non-pageable results explicitly
say which limit or scope to change. `structuredContent` is the complete,
stable machine-readable interface. Large diffs and command output are not
copied into `_meta`; `_meta` is optional UI extension space only.

Tool failures keep the same envelope with `isError: true`, a readable error in
`content`, and this machine shape:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "PATCH_CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS",
    "message": "Patch context matched more than one location.",
    "category": "validation",
    "retryable": true,
    "details": {"path": "src/app.py", "hunk_index": 0, "match_count": 2}
  }
}
```

Known tool error codes include:

```json
["ABSOLUTE_PATH_DENIED", "BINARY_FILE", "ELICITATION_UNSUPPORTED", "GIT_ERROR", "INTERNAL_ERROR", "INVALID_ARGUMENT", "IS_DIRECTORY", "NOT_A_DIRECTORY", "NOT_FOUND", "OUTPUT_TOO_LARGE", "PATCH_CONFLICT", "PATCH_CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS", "PATCH_CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND", "PATCH_FAILED", "PATCH_HUNKS_OVERLAP", "PATCH_ROLLBACK_FAILED", "PATH_OUTSIDE_WORKSPACE", "PERMISSION_REQUIRED", "PROJECT_NOT_FOUND", "RUNTIME_DIR_UNWRITABLE", "SANDBOX_UNAVAILABLE", "SKILL_INVALID", "SKILL_NOT_FOUND", "COMMAND_CLOSED", "COMMAND_LIMIT_REACHED", "COMMAND_NOT_FOUND", "COMMAND_STARTING", "COMMAND_START_FAILED", "IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT", "SHELL_NOT_FOUND", "SHELL_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED", "SYMLINK_ESCAPE", "TTY_UNSUPPORTED", "UNSUPPORTED_ENCODING"]
```

Error categories are `validation`, `security`, `permission`, `runtime`,
`not_found`, `conflict`, and `internal`.

Malformed JSON-RPC uses standard protocol errors: parse `-32700`, invalid
request `-32600`, unknown method `-32601`, invalid params/tool `-32602`, and
unexpected server failure `-32603`.

## Command lifecycle

`exec_command`, `list_commands`, `get_command`, `write_stdin`, `read_output`,
and `kill_command` are always in the catalog. `exec_command` and `write_stdin`
default to a 10-second yield. A short command normally finishes in one call. A
running command returns:

```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "command_id": "...",
  "next_action": {
    "tool": "write_stdin",
    "arguments": {"command_id": "...", "chars": "", "yield_time_ms": 10000}
  }
}
```

Call `write_stdin` with empty `chars` to poll. `read_output` is needed only when
output is truncated or a caller explicitly requested compact retained output.
Its offsets are absolute and independent for stdout and stderr. A single
truncated stream is selected by `next_action`; when both streams are truncated,
`next_actions` contains one executable `read_output` call for each stream.

`exec_command.client_request_id` is an optional stable idempotency key. A retry
with the same key and equivalent execution inputs returns the existing
`command_id` with `deduplicated: true`; a different execution fingerprint
returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`. Concurrent callers reserve the key atomically,
so at most one subprocess starts. `list_commands` and `get_command` expose only
bounded lifecycle/output metadata; command text, stdin, and environment values
are never returned. `get_command` snapshots retained output without advancing
the polling cursor used by `write_stdin`.

Active processes, completed-output commands, per-command bytes, and total
runtime bytes are bounded. Completed commands have a TTL. POSIX `tty=true` uses
a real pseudo-terminal; Windows reports `TTY_UNSUPPORTED` in this build instead
of pretending pipes are a TTY.

## HTTP authentication

Non-loopback deployment requires bearer or OAuth authentication unless the
operator explicitly selects no-auth. OAuth implements Authorization Code +
PKCE S256, protected-resource metadata, authorization-server metadata, exact
redirect URI matching, one-time five-minute codes, 24-hour access tokens, and
RFC 7591 dynamic client registration at `POST /oauth/register`. Public and
confidential clients are bound to their registered authentication method.

Dynamic registrations and authorization codes are process-local; restarting
the server requires clients to register again. Configure a stable
`CODING_TOOLS_MCP_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` and public server URL only when tokens must
survive tunnel churn. Forwarded headers are ignored unless
`CODING_TOOLS_MCP_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=1` is explicitly set.

## Stable tool inventory

The default catalog has 24 tools, including `view_image`. Setting
`CODING_TOOLS_MCP_ENABLE_VIEW_IMAGE=0` is the sole installation capability gate
and removes only that optional binary-content tool. It is not a tool profile.

Each definition below lists the live input property names and annotations. The
authoritative JSON Schemas are returned by `tools/list` and checked for drift in
CI. The annotations recorded here are the truthful ones and are what `server_info`
and the server card always report, including while
`--dangerously-fake-readonly-annotations` is rewriting the hints in `tools/list`.

### server_info

Inputs: none.

Annotations: `{"title":"Server info","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Returns server version, protocol, workspace, cwd, fixed tool count, auth state,
permission mode, runtime directories, project-context metadata, and exec policy.

### check_exec_environment

Inputs: none.

Annotations: `{"title":"Check exec environment","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Returns lightweight policy and Landlock status without running active probes.

### get_default_cwd

Inputs: none.

Annotations: `{"title":"Get default cwd","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Returns the default cwd for the current MCP transport session. It may reset to
the workspace root after a reconnect.

### set_default_cwd

Inputs: `"path"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Set default cwd","readOnlyHint":false,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Changes only the current MCP transport session's navigation base; it does not
modify files. Reliable multi-call workflows should pass `path` or `workdir`
explicitly instead of depending on this value surviving a reconnect.

Example: `{"path":"src"}`.

### list_skills

Inputs: `"workdir"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"List project skills","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Resolves the containing main project and applicable nested project chain from
an explicit existing directory. The result contains the resolved workdir,
applicable instruction-file paths, bounded warnings, and effective skill
metadata (`name`, `description`, owner, scope, source, and source format). It
does not return skill bodies. A workdir outside all discovered projects returns
an empty catalog rather than guessing.

Example: `{"workdir":"seace-minor-sdk/src"}`.

Main-project skills are inserted first. Applicable nested projects may add new
skill names but cannot replace an existing effective name. `.agents` is the
canonical source when `.claude` resolves to the same physical skill.

### read_skill

Inputs: `"workdir"`, `"skill"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Read project skill","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Computes the same effective catalog as `list_skills`, selects one skill by
name, and returns bounded UTF-8 `SKILL.md` content plus metadata, byte counts,
and a truncation flag. The caller cannot provide a raw source path or bypass
root-project precedence. `SKILL_NOT_FOUND` reports only names effective for the
requested workdir; out-of-scope skill locations are not disclosed.

Example: `{"workdir":"seace-minor-sdk/src","skill":"effect-ts"}`.

### read_file

Inputs: `"path"`, `"start_line"`, `"end_line"`, `"max_lines"`, `"max_bytes"`, `"encoding"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Read file","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Reads UTF-8 ranges as a stream, reports full file line/byte metadata, rejects
binary content, and returns continuation metadata when bounded.

### list_dir

Inputs: `"path"`, `"recursive"`, `"max_depth"`, `"max_entries"`, `"include_hidden"`, `"include_ignored"`, `"sort"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"List directory","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

### list_files

Inputs: `"path"`, `"patterns"`, `"glob"`, `"exclude_patterns"`, `"include_hidden"`, `"include_ignored"`, `"max_results"`, `"sort"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"List files","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Traversal is iterative and git-ignore checks are batched.

### search_text

Inputs: `"query"`, `"path"`, `"regex"`, `"case_sensitive"`, `"include_globs"`, `"glob"`, `"exclude_globs"`, `"context_lines"`, `"max_results"`, `"max_preview_bytes"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Search text","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Ripgrep output is consumed incrementally and the process stops once the result
cap is known to be exceeded. `context_lines=0` does not reread matching files.

### apply_patch

Inputs: `"patch"`, `"dry_run"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Apply patch","readOnlyHint":false,"destructiveHint":true,"idempotentHint":false,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Supports `*** Add File`, `*** Update File`, `*** Delete File`, and
`*** Move to` inside a `*** Begin Patch` / `*** End Patch` envelope.

```text
*** Begin Patch
*** Update File: app.py
@@
-old
+new
*** End Patch
```

### exec_command

Inputs: `"cmd"`, `"workdir"`, `"cwd"`, `"timeout_ms"`, `"yield_time_ms"`, `"max_output_bytes"`, `"verbosity"`, `"preview_bytes"`, `"stdin"`, `"tty"`, `"env"`, `"client_request_id"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Execute command","readOnlyHint":false,"destructiveHint":true,"idempotentHint":false,"openWorldHint":true}`.

Statuses are `exited`, `running`, `timeout`, `terminated`, or `failed`.
Launch/policy failures use the error envelope with `status: "failed"`; signal
exits use `terminated`. Ordinary non-zero exit codes still use `exited`.

Example: `{"cmd":"pytest -q","workdir":".","yield_time_ms":30000,"client_request_id":"tests-20260803-01"}`.

### list_commands

Inputs: `"limit"`, `"status"`, `"client_request_id"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"List commands","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Returns bounded active and retained command metadata. It does not expose command
text, stdin, or environment values.

### get_command

Inputs: `"command_id"`, `"client_request_id"`, `"max_output_bytes"`, `"verbosity"`, `"preview_bytes"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Get command","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Exactly one of `command_id` or `client_request_id` is required. The result
recovers status and retained output without advancing the command's polling
cursor.

### write_stdin

Inputs: `"command_id"`, `"chars"`, `"yield_time_ms"`, `"max_output_bytes"`, `"verbosity"`, `"preview_bytes"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Write stdin","readOnlyHint":false,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":false,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Poll or interact with a command. Pass empty `chars` to wait for output.

Poll example: `{"command_id":"abc","chars":"","yield_time_ms":10000}`.
Input example: `{"command_id":"abc","chars":"yes\n"}`.

### kill_command

Inputs: `"command_id"`, `"signal"`, `"wait_ms"`, `"max_output_bytes"`, `"verbosity"`, `"preview_bytes"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Kill command","readOnlyHint":false,"destructiveHint":true,"idempotentHint":false,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Statuses are `["terminated", "killed", "exited", "terminating", "not_found"]`.

Example: `{"command_id":"abc","signal":"KILL"}`.

### read_output

Inputs: `"output_ref"`, `"stream"`, `"offset"`, `"limit"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Read output","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

Example: `{"output_ref":"command:abc:stdout","offset":0,"limit":4096}`.

### git_status

Inputs: `"workdir"`, `"path"`, `"include_untracked"`, `"max_entries"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Git status","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

`workdir` selects the repository for the call. The legacy `path` argument is
retained as a repository-directory alias when `workdir` is omitted. When both
are supplied, `.` is treated as an omitted default and two non-default values
must resolve to the same directory.

### git_diff

Inputs: `"workdir"`, `"path"`, `"paths"`, `"staged"`, `"unstaged"`, `"context_lines"`, `"max_bytes"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Git diff","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

`workdir` selects the repository. `path` and `paths` are optional pathspecs
resolved relative to that directory and may not escape the selected repository.

### git_log

Inputs: `"workdir"`, `"path"`, `"ref"`, `"max_count"`, `"skip"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Git log","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

`workdir` selects the repository and `path` is an optional history pathspec
relative to it. Pagination `next_action` arguments preserve both values.

### git_show

Inputs: `"workdir"`, `"rev"`, `"path"`, `"paths"`, `"include_diff"`, `"context_lines"`, `"max_bytes"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Git show","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

`workdir` selects the repository. Optional `path` and `paths` filters are
resolved relative to that directory.

### git_blame

Inputs: `"workdir"`, `"path"`, `"rev"`, `"start_line"`, `"end_line"`, `"max_lines"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Git blame","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

`workdir` selects the repository and `path` is resolved relative to it.
Pagination `next_action` arguments preserve the explicit repository directory.

### request_permissions

Inputs: `"tool_name"`, `"permission"`, `"reason"`, `"arguments"`, `"scope"`, `"ttl_seconds"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"Request permissions","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":false,"openWorldHint":false}`.

The current server does not advertise MCP elicitation. This tool therefore
returns `ELICITATION_UNSUPPORTED`, except that dangerous mode reports the
operator's explicit auto-grant policy. It never silently escalates safe mode.

### view_image

Inputs: `"path"`, `"max_bytes"`, `"max_width"`, `"max_height"`, `"auto_resize"`.

Annotations: `{"title":"View image","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`.

The base64 data appears exactly once, in one MCP image content block. Stable
`structuredContent` contains metadata only; it has no duplicate base64 or data
URL. Pillow is optional and used only for requested auto-resize.

## Forbidden product-layer tools

The runtime does not expose external-agent login/accounts, agent memory, cloud
tasks, web search/fetch, image generation, model routing, plugin installation,
subagent orchestration, or high-level prompt wrappers.

## Compatibility note for 0.2

0.1 clients that parsed the text block as JSON must switch to
`structuredContent`. The machine fields are retained where practical, while the
text block is now a concise human/model summary. Removed compatibility surfaces
are tool profiles, the `view_image.output` selector, duplicate image data URLs,
and JSON-RPC batches.
